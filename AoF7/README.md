# aof7-docker
Docker-compose for All of Fabric 7

## Setup

To start the docker simply run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

If you want to run the docker in the background, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Update

The server file has to be manually retrieved from CurseForge as they do not expose the download link.
To get it you simply download the server file from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-7) and copy the download link into the docker-compose.yml file.
